Hey there! My name's Caleb.

<img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/me.jpg" alt="that's me, how cute.">

I'm a student at the University of New Mexico. I like to make things, mostly photos, but other things as well. Burque born and bred, probably currently working on some projects.

Do you listen to music on [Spotify?](https://open.spotify.com/user/caleb.brenden?si=4UM3U3EeQgy1LxdPmDLjfA) Follow me over there so we can share our music with each other.

This site was statically generated by Jekyll and hosted for your satisfaction at a very nice website called Github. If you're a computer geek you can check out my source code repository [here](https://github.com/calebbreadsticks/calebbreadsticks.github.io).
